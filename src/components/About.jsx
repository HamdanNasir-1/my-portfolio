    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I am a BTech Computer Science & Engineering student with a strong passion
      for Full Stack Web Development, Backend Engineering, and Machine Learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      I work comfortably on both frontend and backend. On the frontend, I build
      responsive and user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
      On the backend, I focus on clean logic, APIs, and scalable application structure.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a strong foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA in C++),
      which helps me write optimized and maintainable code.
    </p>

    <p>I have applied Machine Learning in real projects:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Spam Detection using Machine Learning</li>
      <li>AI-based Farmer Advisory System</li>
      <li>Hospital Management Website</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I am always eager to learn new technologies, work on meaningful projects,
      and grow as a developer by solving real-world problems.
